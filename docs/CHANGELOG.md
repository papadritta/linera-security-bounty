- `submit_vulnerability()` - Submit security finding
- `verify_submission()` - Approve/reject with payout
- `claim_payout()` - Transfer rewards to researcher

**GraphQL Service (`service.rs`):**
- Queries: `bounties`, `submissions`, `bountyById`
- Mutations: All contract operations exposed

**State Management (`state.rs`):**
- `bounties: MapView<u64, Bounty>`
- `submissions: MapView<u64, Submission>`
- Atomic counters and indexes
