# Linera Security Bounty Platform  
> Decentralized bug bounty protocol for instant payouts, transparent verification, and zero middlemen — powered by Linera microchains.

---

## 1. Vision

In 2025, cybersecurity breaches move faster than traditional bug bounty systems can respond.  
Weeks-long verification cycles, platform fees, and opaque triage processes create friction that discourages researchers and slows down response times for projects.

**Linera Security Bounty** redefines this model with **instant finality, transparent collaboration, and direct payouts** — all secured by Linera’s scalable microchain architecture.  

Our vision:  
> A trustless, real-time security layer for the decentralized web — where every vulnerability report becomes a verifiable on-chain transaction.

---

## 2. Why Now

The Web3 landscape has matured — yet the coordination between **projects** and **security researchers** remains broken:

- Centralized platforms take high fees and delay payouts.  
- Verification and communication happen off-chain.  
- Researchers have no on-chain proof of their contributions.  
- Projects lack real-time visibility into vulnerabilities and payouts.

With **Linera’s microchains**, each bounty program gains isolated state, predictable execution, and millisecond-level finality.  
This makes it finally possible to build a **live, transparent, and trust-minimized** bounty market.

### The Window Is Open

**Market timing is perfect:**
- Web3 security incidents hit all-time high in 2024
- Traditional platforms alienating top researchers with delays
- Linera's mainnet launch creates first-mover advantage
- Regulatory pressure increasing for transparent processes

**Build now, dominate later.** The first decentralized bounty protocol that actually works will capture the market.

## 3. Core Idea

Each bounty program runs on its own **Linera microchain**, acting as a self-contained escrow and verification unit.  

1. A project deploys a bounty contract with reward parameters.  
2. Security researchers submit vulnerabilities directly to that contract.  
3. The project verifies and approves the submission.  
4. Payouts are released automatically — instantly, on-chain.  
5. All actions are transparent and verifiable.

No intermediaries. No waiting. No disputes outside the protocol.

## 4. Key Features

| For Security Researchers | For Project Owners |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Submit vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept | Create and manage bounty programs |
| Real-time status updates | Set reward tiers and severity levels |
| Instant on-chain payouts | Verify submissions through secure workflow |
| Transparent contribution record | Pause or close programs anytime |

**Technical foundation:**  
- Built in **Rust** using the **Linera SDK (v0.16.0)**  
- On-chain logic compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)**  
- Frontend served via **GraphQL API (port 8080)** for queries and mutations

## 5. How It Works

1. **Create a bounty** → project defines target address, severity thresholds, and reward pool.  
2. **Submit a vulnerability** → researcher provides PoC and severity rating.  
3. **Verify** → project validates and marks the issue as approved/rejected.  
4. **Claim payout** → approved researcher receives instant on-chain reward.  
5. **Audit trail** → all interactions recorded immutably on Linera microchains.

Each microchain executes deterministically, ensuring zero race conditions and consistent results across the network.

## 6. Why Linera

**Microchains** provide a unique combination of:
- **Isolated state:** Each bounty program runs independently.  
- **Instant finality:** Results confirmed in milliseconds.  
- **Predictable performance:** Parallel scaling across thousands of chains.  
- **Native security:** Deterministic execution reduces exploits and congestion.  

This is not just another dApp — it’s a real-time, on-chain coordination layer for security ecosystems.

## 7. Technology Stack

- **Rust** — safe, performant backend language  
- **Linera SDK 0.16.0** — for microchain creation and GraphQL integration  
- **GraphQL API** — standardized query/mutation interface  
- **WASM Contracts** — deterministic business logic execution  
- **HTML/JS Frontend** — lightweight local interface

## 10. Vision 2030 — The Future of Decentralized Security

The long-term goal is a **universal bounty protocol** — a network where  
every blockchain project can host programs, every researcher has verified proof of work,  
and every reward is executed without delay or middlemen.

> **Security is not a service — it’s a shared protocol.**  
> Linera Security Bounty aims to make it trustless, instant, and open to all.

**Built with ❤️ and Rust — for a safer decentralized future.**
